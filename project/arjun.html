    <h1>STORY</h1><br>
    Arjun Reddy Deshmukh is a house surgeon at St. Mary's Medical College in Mangalore, India. Despite being a brilliant student, he has severe anger <br>management problems that earn the wrath of the college dean. Arjun's aggressive nature also earns him a reputation among his juniors as a college <br>bully. After a brawl alongside his friend Kamal against members of the opposing team during an inter-college football match the dean asks Arjun to<br> either apologise or leave the college. Arjun initially chooses to leave the college, but stays back after meeting first-year student Preethi <br>Shetty.
    Arjun and his friend Shiva enter a third-year classroom and announce that Arjun is in love with Preethi and asserts that she is exclusive to him. <br>Initially afraid, Preethi starts adjusting to Arjun's overbearing attitude. She eventually reciprocates his feelings and they develop an intimate <br>relationship. Arjun graduates with an MBBS degree and leaves for Mussoorie to pursue a Master's degree in Orthopedic surgery. Over the course of <br>three years, Arjun's and Preethi's relationship becomes stronger. Months later, Arjun visits Preethi's house, where her father sees them kissing and <br>throws Arjun out.
