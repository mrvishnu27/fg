    <h1>STORY</h1><br>
    A special agent investigates a murder committed by a masked group of serial killers. However, a tangled maze of clues soon leads him to the drug kingpin <br>of Chennai.<br>
    The film does starts off intriguingly, when Karnan (Kamal Haasan), the father of a martyred cop Prapanchan (Kalidas Jayaram) is killed. We learn that <br>there has been a series of such killings with a group of masked men taking responsibility for it and calling it their war against the system. Police <br>chief Jose (Chemban Vinod Jose) brings in a black ops team headed by Amar (Fahadh Faasil), who starts digging into Karnan's life. The chief suspect <br>is Sandhanam (Vijay Sethupathi), a fearsome drug lord with a large family, who is searching for a shipment of raw material that could make him a <br>kingpin. Meanwhile, Amar is puzzled by the many versions of Karnan. Was he an alcoholic father grieving over the loss of his son, a womaniser or <br>much more? More importantly, is he dead or alive?
