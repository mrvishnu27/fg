<h1>STORY</h1><br>
<h3>To save the saviour Murali Krishna from an evil Varadarajulu's trap, Lord Shiva's ardent devotee, Akhanda, moves heaven and earth. <br>
    Now, let's get into Akhanda's story. During a rainy night, a woman gives birth to twins. A godman (Jagapathi Babu) senses that one of the twins has a duty <br> to perform and gives him to a saint, who takes him to Kasi. He grows up to be Akhanda (Nandamuri Balakrishna AKA Balyya), a godman who cannot be <br>
    touched by anybody or anything. In Boyapati's universe, anything means bullets, axes, knives and other weapons.  <br>
    The other kid named Murali Krishna is a farmer who uses his money to help people. Saranya (Pragya Jaiswal) becomes the collector of the district, who falls  <br> in love with Murali Krishna. In a span of five minutes, over a song, they get married and have a kid.</h3>
