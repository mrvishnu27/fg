   <h1> STORY</h1><br>
    Major Ajay Krishna (Mahesh Babu) is posted in Kashmir and leads a team of soldiers. During a rescue mission, one of his teammates gets fatally injured<br> because of which he couldn’t attend his sister’s wedding. So, Ajay goes to Kurnool to meet his teammate’s mother Bharathi (Vijayshanti) to <br>help them with the wedding and eventually break the news when he sees fit. When Ajay lands in Kurnool, he discovers that Bharathi and family are <br>running for their life and MLA Nagendra (Prakash Raj) is behind it.<br>
    Director Anil Ravipudi’s Sarileru Neekevvaru was promised to be a proper family entertainer. While he made his hero mouth dialogues about respecting <br>women, he almost forgot to implement it in his writing. The end product is the horrific stretch featuring Rashmika Mandanna. Let’s get to that later.
