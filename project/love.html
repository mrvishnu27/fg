    <H1>STORY</H1><br>
    While a couple is deeply in love, her father challenges the two to switch their phones with each other to test their relationship. Chaos ensues as the <br>lovers' secrets are unearthed.<br>
    Do you ever truly know someone? Isn’t there a side in all of us that we are always shielding from the outside? Trust is the foundation of any <br>relationship; it is the DNA that binds a romantic relationship. But how much are you willing to trust? You might know your partner a little too <br>well. Yet, there is always a curiosity to know more that sometimes it borderlines into misplaced trust. In the age of smartphones, aren’t we all <br>victims of knowing too little? This curiosity to know more takes the shape of a dramatic plot point in Pradeep Ranganathan’s Love Today. Although I <br>would strongly argue that his short film on which this film is based, was the better film.
