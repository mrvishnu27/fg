   <H1>STORY</H1><br>
    A labourer named Pushpa makes enemies as he rises in the world of red sandalwood smuggling. However, violence erupts when the police attempt to bring <br>down his illegal business.<br>
    Pushpa Raj (Allu Arjun) is one of the many coolies in Seshachalam who chop down red sandalwood illegally and sell it by the kilo to powers-that-be. In a<br> syndicate that consists of numerous players, Pushpa slowly learns to find his footing and rise in ranks till the man who would once chop down <br>these trees becomes the one giving the orders. However, his Achilles heel is not his lady love Srivalli (Rashmika Mandanna), or the big-wigs Konda <br>Reddy (Ajay Ghosh), Jolly Reddy (Dhananjay), Mangalam Srinu (Sunil) and his wife Dakshayani (Anasuya Baradwaj). It is the fact that his brother <br>(Ajay) won’t let him claim his lineage, something that takes Pushpa from zero to hundred in no time and often becomes the reason for this laid-back, <br>sarcastic, arrogant, even funny man to lose his cool. And right as he gets where he wants to be in life, in comes IPS Bhanwar Singh Shekawat (Fahadh Faasil)<br> threatening to upend the carefully constructed order that Pushpa has put in place.
