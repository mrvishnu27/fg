<h1>STORY</h1>
<h3>A fearless revolutionary and an officer in the British force, who once shared a deep bond, decide to join forces and chart out an inspirational path of <br>freedom against the despotic rulers. But what truly forms the source of the film? Director Rajamouli has repeatedly stressed that RRR heavily <br>fictionalises the lives of two freedom fighters and revolutionaries in the 1920s – Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem. The director has said in <br>various interviews that there isn’t much information available about these revolutionaries and RRR attempts to bridge that deficit while also honouring<br> the spirit of these freedom fighters.</h3>
